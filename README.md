# Azure Machine Learning Tutorial

This repo is an Azure Machine Learning services tutorial that multiple steps - from data ingestion to model deployment. The steps in this process are:

1. [Upgrade azureml-sdk](00-Upgrade_azureml-sdk.ipynb)
1. [Register your Workspace](01-Register_Workspace.ipynb)
1. [Register your Storage Account as a Datastore](02-Register_Datastore.ipynb)
1. [Load your Data into your Storage Account with Azure Storage Explorer](03-Load_Data_to_Datastore.ipynb)
1. [Register your Data as a Dataset](04-Register_Dataset.ipynb)
1. [Refine your Data, Save it to your Datastore and Register it as a Dataset](05-Refine_Date.ipynb)
1. [Transform your Refined Data, Save it in your Datastore and Register it as a Dataset](06-Transform_Data.ipynb)
1. [Create Remote Compute Targets to Run your Models](07-Create_Compute_Targets.ipynb)
1. [Use your Data to Train and Register a Model with AutoML](08-AutoML_Train_and_Register_Model.ipynb)
1. [Deploy your AutoML Model to Real Time Scoring Endpoints](09-Deploy_Model_as_REST_API.ipynb)
1. [Deploy your Model to a Batch Execution ML Pipeline Endpoint](10-Deploy_Model_as_Batch_Inference.ipynb)
